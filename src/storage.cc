/*
 * EEPROM data structure ("file system"):
 *
 * Organized as 32B-pages, all animations/texts are page-aligned.  Byte 0 ..
 * 255 : storage metadata. Byte 0 contains the number of animations, byte 1 the
 * page offset of the first animation, byte 2 of the second, and so on.
 * Byte 256+: texts/animations without additional storage metadata, aligned
 * to 32B. So, a maximum of 256-(256/32) = 248 texts/animations can be stored,
 * and a maximum of 255 * 32 = 8160 Bytes (almost 8 kB / 64 kbit) can be
 * addressed.  To support larger EEPROMS, change the metadate area to Byte 2 ..
 * 511 and use 16bit page pointers.
 *
 * The text/animation size is not limited by this approach.
 *
 * Example:
 * Byte     0 = 3 -> we've got a total of three animations
 * Byte     1 = 0 -> first text/animation starts at byte 256 + 32*0 = 256
 * Byte     2 = 4 -> second starts at byte 256 + 32*4 = 384
 * Byte     3 = 5 -> third starts at 256 + 32*5 * 416
 * Byte     4 = whatever
 *            .
 *            .
 *            .
 * Byte 256ff = first text/animation. Has a header encoding its length in bytes.
 * Byte 384ff = second
 * Byte 416ff = third
 *            .
 *            .
 *            .
